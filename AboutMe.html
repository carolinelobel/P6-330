        <p class="bio">Hi, my name is Caroline Lobel.  I am currently a second-year student at Northwestern University 
            studying computer science with an interest in its application to biotechnology.  
        </p>
        <p class="bio">
            Outside of school, I am involved in a few different extracurriculars.  One thing I am involved in is 
            Student Holdings NFP, a nonprofit organization that manages four student-run businesses at Northwestern.  
            I am a technology manager for Student Holdings, so I manage the website and online store for Ink Tank, a custom 
            apparel business.  See my resume for some more activities that I am involved in!
        </p>
        <p class="bio">
            One of my goals as a computer science major is to learn how to create applications that will improve the 
            users' lifestyles.  A key part of that goal is making sure my applications are accessible to the user.  What 
            I have learned in my Human-Computer Interaction course at Northwestern will definitely help me to reach my goal.
